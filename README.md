## Struggles/Complications During Assignment ##
The only complications I really came across were getting the tooltip to work. The drop cap was fairly straightforward. I'm still struggling to understand how exactly the bubble needs to be coded. A classmate helped me with some of the issues I was having with this assignment, which helped tremendously in the understanding of how the tooltips work.

## Lighthouse Report ##
The report showed there are some speed issues, but it wasn't anything I could personally fix (at this moment anyway). Otherwise, the scores were good for accessibility.
